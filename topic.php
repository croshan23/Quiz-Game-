        <h2>The Web 3.0</h2>
        <p>
            John Markoff of the New York Times as of late recommended naming this third-era of the Web, "Web 3.0". This proposal has prompted a lot of level headed discussion inside the business. The individuals who are appended to the Web 2.0 moniker have responded by guaranteeing that such a term is not justified while others have reacted emphatically to the term, taking note of that there is for sure a trademark contrast between the coming new phase of the Web and what Web 2.0 has come to speak to.

            The term Web 2.0 was never clearly defined and even today if one asks ten people what it means one will likely get ten different definitions. However, most people in the Web industry would agree that Web 2.0 focuses on several major themes, including AJAX, social networking, folksonomies, lightweight collaboration, social bookmarking, and media sharing. While the innovations and practices of Web 2.0 will continue to develop, they are not the final step in the evolution of the Web.

                The term Web 2.0 was never plainly characterized and even today on the off chance that one asks ten individuals what it implies one will probably get ten unique definitions. In any case, the vast majority in the Web business would concur that Web 2.0 spotlights on a few noteworthy topics, including AJAX, informal communication, folksonomies, lightweight cooperation, social bookmarking, and media sharing. While the advancements and practices of Web 2.0 will keep on developing, they are not the last stride in the advancement of the Web.
