        <h2>The Web 3.0</h2>
        <p>
            The Web is entering another period of advancement. There has been much civil argument as of late about what to call this new stage. Some would want to not name it all, while others propose keeping on calling it "Web 2.0". Be that as it may, this new period of advancement has a significant diverse center from what Web 2.0 has come to mean.           
        </p>
        <p>
            John Markoff of the New York Times as of late recommended naming this third-era of the Web, "Web 3.0". This proposal has prompted a lot of level headed discussion inside the business. The individuals who are appended to the Web 2.0 moniker have responded by guaranteeing that such a term is not justified while others have reacted emphatically to the term, taking note of that there is for sure a trademark contrast between the coming new phase of the Web and what Web 2.0 has come to speak to.
